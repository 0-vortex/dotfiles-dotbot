The 3270 font is derived from the x3270 font, which, in turn, was
translated from the one in Georgia Tech's 3270tool, which was itself
hand-copied from a 3270-series terminal.

Both the final font Truetype/OpenType files and the design files used
to produce the font family are distributed under an open licence and
you are expressly encouraged to experiment, modify, share and improve.
